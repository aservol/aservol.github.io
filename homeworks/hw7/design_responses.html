						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that design and psychology were linked. This is why we usually make connections between a simple shape and creating a big picture. Even our brain can fill in the gasps when parts are missing.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favourite part of this article was about the multi-stability explanation. It is very interesting to see how our brain can see objects in many ways as there is no "true" picture. We can definitively play with this and try to seek different views about one ambiguous object. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"The whole is other than the sum of the parts" - Kurt Koffka. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>I would give a 7 to this article as it gave us a perfect overview about the 4 key ideas on visual communication manipulation. </p>
