                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>Simply by observing several designs, we can see the many concepts that we have learned in the last few weeks. I was able to understand that the notion of "space" is very important in visual rendering. As a user, it's very nice to see the different designs integrate white spaces to better perceive the entirety of the data on screen (text, images, colors). </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favourite part was about the inspiration given on screens because it gives a better visual result of what we could have in our hands. I could observe that no matter what color choosen, by just correctly match them, we can produce beautiful designs. Also, the designs incorporated moving images which was an interesting concept.      </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>Nike's inspiration is my favorite because it involves the user in the design. Having a moving image to choose the colors of your shoes makes the design more interactive. Indeed, the user can also choose the size of his shoes by using the sliders provided. The interface is successful thanks to the integrated white spaces and the tone of the colors that are well associated. Moreover, the typography is modern, as the sports brand's image.</p>

                            <p> I put a 6/10 to this article because there were too much images and not that much explanations which would have been more interested.  </p>
